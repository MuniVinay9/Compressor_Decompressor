# Compressor_Decompressor
This project aims to achieve efficient data compression by utilizing compression techniques that effectively reduce the number of required bits for data representation while ensuring data integrity through the use of lossless conversion methods. The project focuses solely on employing lossless compression techniques to eliminate any potential data loss during compression.

By employing compression techniques, the project offers several benefits such as optimizing storage space, accelerating file transfers, and reducing costs associated with storage hardware and network bandwidth. These advantages ultimately lead to improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness in managing data.

One key objective of this project is to prioritize data integrity. All compressed files generated using the compression techniques must be capable of being accurately restored to their original form during the decompression process, ensuring no loss of information.

Successful implementation of this project will bring significant advancements in data compression, enabling enhanced storage efficiency, streamlined file transfers, and cost savings in storage infrastructure and network bandwidth utilization.

The project will be developed using the Java programming language and the JavaSwing framework. The Intellij IDEA integrated development environment (IDE) will be utilized for coding and project management.
